        <h2>Father of the Indian Nuclear Programme</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Homi Jehangir Bhabha</b> was an Indian nuclear physicist who is widely credited as the "father of the
          Indian nuclear programme". He was the founding director and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of
          Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay
          (AEET) which was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET served as the
          cornerstone of the Indian nuclear energy and weapons programme. He was the first chairman of the Indian Atomic
          Energy Commission and secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy. By supporting space science projects which
          initially derived their funding from the AEC, he played an important role in the birth of the Indian space
          programme.

          He was awarded the Adams Prize (1942) and Padma Bhushan (1954), and nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physics
          in 1951 and 1953–1956.

          He died in the crash of Air India Flight 101 in 1966, at the age of 56.

          <h3>Homi Bhabha Career</h3>

          When the war broke in Europe, Bhabha was in India and decided to not return to England for the time being.

          He started his career with the Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, as a Reader in Physics on the behest
          of Nobel laureate CV Raman who at that time headed the Physics department in the institute.

          Two years later in 1942, Bhabha was elected as a member of the Royal Society and was later elected a Fellow of
          the Indian Academy of Sciences. In 1943, he was appointed as the President of the Physics section of the
          Indian Science Congress.

          He convinced many senior leaders of the Congress Party to start an ambitious nuclear programme. As part of his
          vision, he first established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute and later the Tata Institute of
          Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Bombay in 1945 with financial help from JRD Tata.

          In 1948, he set up the Atomic Energy Commission and served as its first Chairperson. The same year, he was
          appointed by Jawaharlal Nehru as the director of the nuclear program and was tasked to develop nuclear
          weapons.

          In 1950, he represented India in IAEA conferences and served as President of the United Nations Conference on
          the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955.

          From 1960 to 1963, he served as the President of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.

          <h3>Homi Bhabha Legacy</h3>
          After his death in 1966, the Atomic Energy Establishment in Mumbai was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research
          Centre in his honour.

          A radio telescope in India's Ooty was his initiative which became a reality in 1970.

          Homi Bhabha National Institute, an Indian deemed university, and the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science
          Education in Mumbai are the noted institutions in his name.
